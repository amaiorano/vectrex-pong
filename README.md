# Vectrex Pong

This is a simple pong clone for the Vectrex. I wrote it mainly to build a good pipeline and codebase for developing Vectrex games in C++. I started from [Joakim Larsson's VectrexTutoial](https://github.com/JoakimLarsson/VectrexTutorial), then fixed some issues with building C++, and improved the Makefile for multi-source projects. I also integrated some fixes by [Malban/PeerC](http://vectrexc.malban.de/).
